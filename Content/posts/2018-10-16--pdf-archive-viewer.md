It's been a while since the last post and a few things have changed on the project.
First of all, I would like to thank all the nice people, who contacted me and said, how the [PDF Archiver](https://github.com/JulianKahnert/PDF-Archiver) improved their workflow.
All this positive feedback helps me and encourages me to continue working on it actively.
Furthermore there have been some awesome blogposts about the app.
I would like to emphasize two german reviews in particular.
[iFun](https://www.ifun.de/pdf-archiver-deutlich-verbessert-und-mit-symbolischem-abo-preis-124604/) wrote an update of their [original story](https://www.ifun.de/pdf-archiver-open-source-projekt-zur-langzeit-archivierung-119547/) and [Sir Apfelot](https://www.sir-apfelot.de/pdf-archiver-22021/) posted a wonderful detailed and affectionately written review.

Today I released Version 1.3.6, which includes some bugfixes and two major features.
First, [PDF Archiver](https://github.com/JulianKahnert/PDF-Archiver) now supports the all new macOS Dark Mode and I really love it!

And second, the app supports iCloud Drive, which can be enabled in the preferences (`âŒ˜ ,`) now.
This feature moves all your documents to iCloud Drive where they can be synced between devices.
That said, please keep in mind to backup all your archived documents regularly to a separate location, such as an external hard drive.
It is always more secure to have a copy of all documents independent of the scope of fancy iCloud syncing magic.
The iCloud Drive feature (finally) brings me to the reason of this blogpost:

PDF Archiver structures an archive of PDFs and you can find them quickly via the [naming convention](https://github.com/pdf-Archiver/pdf-archiver#scroll-convention) and the Finder tags.
But what if you need to lookup something, when you don't have your computer nearby?
Your iPhone might be a device, which helps out in those cases.
That's why I built the open source app [PDF Archive Viewer](https://github.com/PDF-Archiver/PDF-Archive-Viewer), which can be downloaded from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pdf-archiver/id1352719750?mt=12) for free.
With this app you can view all your tagged documents and search for the one you want to have a look at.
Just give it a try! If you like it, I would love to hear your story in a [App Store review](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1433801905?action=write-review) ... and if you don't like it, [let me know why](mailto:mail@pdf-archiver.io). ðŸ˜Š
